# Document Verification System Plan

## Information Gathered:
- The `Documentverification.sol` contract allows users to add, verify, and retrieve educational credentials on the blockchain.
- The contract includes functions for adding credentials, verifying them, and fetching credential details.

## Plan:
1. **Smart Contract:**
   - Utilize the existing `CredentialVerification` contract to manage the credentials.
   - Ensure that the contract is deployed on a blockchain network (e.g., Ethereum testnet).

2. **Front-End Development:**
   - **index.html:**
     - Create a user interface for users to input their credentials (name, degree, institution, graduation year).
     - Add buttons for adding credentials and verifying them.
     - Display the verification status of credentials.

   - **script.js:**
     - Integrate Web3.js or Ethers.js to interact with the deployed smart contract.
     - Implement functions to call the smart contract methods for adding and verifying credentials.
     - Update the UI based on the responses from the smart contract.

3. **Styling:**
   - Use `style.css` to style the user interface for better user experience.

4. **Testing:**
   - Test the entire flow of adding and verifying credentials on a local blockchain or testnet.
   - Ensure that events are emitted correctly and the UI updates as expected.

## Follow-Up Steps:
- Deploy the smart contract to a blockchain network.
- Test the front-end functionality with the deployed contract.
